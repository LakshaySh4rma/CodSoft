# Portfolio Design
The portfolio website project is a personal web application designed to showcase my skills, projects, and professional experiences as a developer. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the site features a clean, modern design that highlights my work through interactive galleries and detailed project descriptions. The responsive layout ensures optimal viewing across all devices, providing an engaging user experience. The website includes sections for my bio, contact information, and links to my GitHub and LinkedIn profiles. This project demonstrates my expertise in frontend development, UI/UX design, and my ability to effectively communicate my professional brand online.
